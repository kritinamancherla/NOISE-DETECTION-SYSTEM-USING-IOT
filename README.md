# NOISE-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-IOT
An IoT-based noise detection system designed for real-time monitoring and effective management of noise pollution within urban environments, contributing to the essential infrastructure for smart cities. 

Project Description: Noise Detection System Using IoT
The Noise Detection System Using IoT is a project designed to monitor and measure environmental noise levels and provide real-time data and alerts. This system is beneficial in various scenarios like industrial noise monitoring, traffic management, residential area sound pollution detection, and event monitoring.

The system uses IoT-enabled sensors to collect noise level data, which is then processed and sent to a cloud platform for visualization and analysis. Alerts can be triggered when noise exceeds predefined thresholds.

Methods
Data Acquisition

A sound sensor (e.g., Microphone Module or Sound Detection Sensor) captures sound intensity levels.
The sensor output is read by a microcontroller like ESP8266 or ESP32.
Data Processing

The microcontroller processes the analog sound input, converts it to decibels (dB), and determines if it exceeds predefined noise thresholds.
Data Transmission

Noise data is transmitted to a cloud server using Wi-Fi or LoRaWAN.
Data Storage and Visualization

Platforms like Thingspeak, AWS IoT, or Google Firebase store and visualize the data in real time.
Alerts

Notifications or alerts are triggered via email, SMS, or app notifications (using services like Twilio, IFTTT, or MQTT) when the noise level exceeds a set threshold.
